## Hello ðŸ‘‹ my name is Lee.

I'm currently a postgraduate student at University College London (UCL) ðŸŽ“ studying MSc Software Systems Engineering, with a strong interest in designing and operating distributed systems.

Outside of my academic studies, I am improving my programming skills through my car data app, Go Reg Go ðŸš™. In my spare time I focus on keeping the backend systems stable and reliable.

Previously, I was at Sound In The City ðŸ“º developing internal-facing client ordering systems for AV hire in London. I worked on integrating distributed database instances, custom business logic, alongside designing and implementing the backend infrastructure underpinning everything.

You can find me on LinkedIn or send me an email. I'm also on GitHub.

I'm interested in hearing about roles related to software engineering and developing cloud-native distributed systems. If you think i'd be a good fit, check out my CV/RÃ©sumÃ©.
